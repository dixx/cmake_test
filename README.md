# Setup

- make sure you have installed and available:
  - `make`
  - `gcc`
  - `cmake`
- switch to folder `cmake`
- depending on your OS, execute
  *Linux/OSX*: `cmake ..`
  *Windows*: `cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..` if you have MinGW installed
  This will create you a perfect Makefile.
- now you can execute `make` to build your project, and `make install` to install it into your system.
