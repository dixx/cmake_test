# Setup

- make sure you have `make` and `gcc`/`g++` available
- install CMake
- switch to folder `cmake`
- depending on your OS, execute
  *Linux/OSX*: `cmake ..`
  *Windows*: `cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..` if you have MinGW installed
  This will create you a perfect Makefile.
- now you can execute `make` to build your project.
